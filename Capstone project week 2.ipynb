The K-means method is a classic data mining and signal processing algorithm, with the purpose of iteratively partitioning n observations in k clusters in which each observation has a distance of an average value for each cluster, called centroid. The iterative process seeks to maximize the distance between clusters and to minimize the distance within the clusters for optimal convergence.\n\n\n"
